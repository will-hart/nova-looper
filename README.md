# Nova Looper

![Nova Looper screenshots](./screenshot.jpg)

A game made in about three days for the GMTK 2025 Game Jam.

The theme was "looper". My intention was to make a really simple game and then
spend a bit of time polishing and working with shaders and particles to make
it a bit more interesting visually (I'm not sure I got there, but I tried!)

Its a very simple game, press `spacebar`, tap the screen or click the left
mouse button to pilot the ship around the sun collecting energy. Don't fly too
close for too long or you'll burn up!
